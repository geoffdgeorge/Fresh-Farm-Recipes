# **Fresh Farm Recipes**
Fresh Farm Recipes is a front-end application relying primarily on two APIs to provide recipe suggestions to any user, based on up to three fresh ingredients they can submit as search parameters. The application also provides the locations and schedules of nearby farmers' markets where ingredients can be obtained, based on a zip code submitted by the user.

The map that's displayed to show the farmers' markets is powered by Leaflet JS.
