# **Fresh Farm Recipes**
Fresh Farm Recipes is a front-end application relying primarily on two APIs to provide recipe suggestions to any user, based on up to three fresh ingredients they can submit as search parameters. The application also provides the locations and schedules of nearby farmers' markets where ingredients can be obtained, based on a zip code submitted by the user.

# Dependencies

The Fresh Farm Recipes app relies on two APIs and three libraries:

* [The Edamam API](https://developer.edamam.com/) (which returns recipes based on provided ingredients)
* [The USDA Farmers Market API](https://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/v1/svcdesc.html) (which returns the locations and schedules of more than 8,600 registered farmers' markets across the US)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) (to power the site's front-end functions, including the AJAX requests to the two APIs)
* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) (to build and populate the map displaying the names, addresses, and schedules of nearby farmers' markets)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (to rapidly and uniformly build out the app's HTML/CSS)
